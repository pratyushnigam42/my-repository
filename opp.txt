How to get OPP manager log file location?

$APPLCSF/log/<SID>/FNDOPP####.txt       OR
1,System Administrator > Concurrent > Manager > Administer
2,Search for ‘Output Post Processor’
3,Click the ‘Processes’ button .
4,Click the Manager Log button. This will open the ‘OPP’
Upload the OPP log file.



OPP Issue while generating the XML Output in apps 11i

Problem Description:
1, Few XML type concurrent programs taking long time and completed with warning OPP log file registered below error
Caused by: java.lang.ThreadDeath
2, CPU utilization taking 100% constantly while running the concurrent programs.

Cause
The java.lang.ThreadDeath error indicates that the Output Post Processor has reached its processing timeout.

Solution
The following configuration changes are recommended to optimize the environment for these type of reports:
1. Increase the value of the Concurrent: OPP Timeout profile option to 10800 seconds.

2. Enable the scalability feature of XML Publisher:

1. Login as SYSADMIN
2. Responsibility: XML Publisher Administrator
3. Function: Administration
4. Set the following properties:
5. Temporary Directory
6. Use XML Publisher’s XSLT processor: True
7. Enable scalable feature of XSLT processor: True   — By default it’s false
8. Enable XSLT runtime optimization: True

> After changing the value also the problem still exist. As per the SR suggestion, we increased the java heap size from 1024M to 2048M.

a. Bring down the concurrent managers.

b. Use the Update statement below, for example:
update FND_CP_SERVICES
set DEVELOPER_PARAMETERS =
‘J:oracle.apps.fnd.cp.gsf.GSMServiceController:-mx2048m’
where SERVICE_ID = (select MANAGER_TYPE from FND_CONCURRENT_QUEUES
where CONCURRENT_QUEUE_NAME = ‘FNDCPOPP’);

c. Bring concurrent managers up again

How to start the Output Post Processing (OPP) in 11i
At least one OPP process active in the system. The concurrent processing uses the Output Post Processor (OPP) to enforce post-processing actions for concurrent requests. For example, post-processing action is that used in publishing concurrent requests with XML Publisher.

Actually when you have submit a request with XML Publisher template specified as a layout for the concurrent request output. Once finishes the concurrent manager concurrent program, it will contact the OPP to apply the XML Publisher template and create the final output

To activate the OPP follow these setps

The Profile Option "Concurrent: GSM Enabled" must be set to Y

Then:
1. Login to Apps with sysadmin responsibility
2. Navigate to: Concurrent -> Managers -> Define
3. Query for
Manager = 'Output Post Processor%'
or Short Name = FNDCPOPP
4. Check the checkbox "Enable" .
5. Click on 'Work Shifts button
6. see Work Shift of the OPP and
Set Processes = 1
and Parameters = oracle.apps.fnd.cp.opp.OPPServiceThread:2:0:max_threads=5
and Sleep Second = 30
7. Save
